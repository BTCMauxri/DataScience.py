# This script will demonstrate the difference in mathematical operations
# between lists and numpy arrays in python
# Creating 2 lists
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
l2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Creating 2 numpy arrays from the lists
a1 = np.array(l1)
a2 = np.array(l2)


print(f"The result of multiplying list 1 by 5 is: {l1 * 5}")
print(f"The result of multiplying array 1 by 5 is: {a1 * 5}")

# Similarly with multi-dimensional arrays
a3 = np.array([1, 2, 3])    # a 1 * 3 array
a4 = np.array([[4],         # a 2 by 1 array
               [5]])

print(a3 + a4)              # addition
print(a3 - a4)              # subtraction
print(a3 * a4)              # multiplication
print(a3 / a4)              # division

# some of these operations would work differently or not work on normal lists

# The following are some mathematical functions 
a = np.array([[4, 9, 16],
              [25, 36, 49]])

print(np.sqrt(a))           # The square root function
# there are also pn.sin() , np.cos(), etc
